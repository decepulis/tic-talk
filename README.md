A Time Management Project

The Senior Design project of decepulis and sapostoluk for graduation with our Computer Engineering degrees from the University of Cincinnati in 2018.

Effective time management is a skill that many students struggle to master, causing stress in their day-to-day lives and negatively impacting their mental and physical health. To help students better manage their time, we developed a cross-platform web application to help students better manage their time. The application allows students to input their upcoming assignments and schedule them as desired while suggesting how long specific tasks will take. Task duration is estimated using a custom algorithm that factors in user estimates and past duration history. The application has an option to automatically schedule times to work on tasks, which can then be rescheduled by the user. The application uses Google Calendar to store information and also accounts for the userâ€™s preexisting schedule. Ultimately, we have succeeded in creating a tool that we believe encourages good time management habits without being a nuisance to the user, meeting our goals.
